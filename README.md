# Suggestion Engine for Wikimedia Commons Upload Wizard!

Hello fellow Wikimedia Commons contributors! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Daanvr, and I'd like to introduce you to the Suggestion Engineâ€”a user script designed to make your media uploading experience more efficient and streamlined.

As a frequent uploader myself, I know how time-consuming it can be to manually search for the perfect categories and depiction statements for each image. That's why I created the Suggestion Engineâ€”to simplify the process and provide you with intelligent suggestions based on the geolocation of your uploaded images.

## ðŸŒŸ What the Suggestion Engine Can Do for You

- **Automatic Category Suggestions**: Say goodbye to the hassle of searching for relevant categories! The Suggestion Engine analyzes the categories of nearby images and suggests the most appropriate ones for your upload. Each suggestion includes the distance from your image's location, giving you valuable context for your selection.

- **Depiction Statement Recommendations (Coming Soon)**: In addition to categories, the Suggestion Engine will soon provide recommendations for depiction statements based on Wikidata. This feature is currently under development and will be available in a future update.

- **Frequency-Based Ordering**: The suggested categories are intelligently ordered based on their frequency of occurrence in nearby images. This means that the most commonly used and relevant categories in the vicinity of your image are prominently displayed, making it easier for you to choose the most suitable ones.

- **Seamless Integration**: The Suggestion Engine seamlessly integrates with the existing Wikimedia Commons upload interface. The suggestions are displayed in a clean and intuitive manner, blending perfectly with the platform's look and feel.

- **Customizable Settings**: The script includes a set of configurable parameters that allow you to fine-tune the behavior of the Suggestion Engine according to your preferences. You can easily adjust settings such as the radius for location-based suggestions and the number of nearby files to consider.
